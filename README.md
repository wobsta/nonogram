# Nonogram programming course

This repository is a programming course for beginners. It is particularily
suitable for people knowing and enjoying [nonograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram),
including kids. It uses Python 3.8+ to build a simple nonogram solver in
10 basic lectures. Five further lectures show more features to encourage
own experiments and improvements.

The material contains just the code and needs an experienced teacher to explain
all the material and techniques. As a brief guide we provide just a very few words
to each lecture here:

## Lecture 1

Hello world an a few math operations with variables and f-strings.

## Lecture 2

`for` loop on ranges and lists.

## Lecture 3

Some more basic features of lists. Conditions. `while` loop.

## Lecture 4

Conditions with `and` and `or`. Loop in loops.

## Lecture 5

Functions. Generating a nonogram line of a list of booleans.

## Lecture 6

Recursion.

## Lecture 7

Putting together lecture 5 and 6 to generate parts of a line for a nonogram. Introducing `None`.

## Lecture 8

Improve a line.

## Lecture 9

Introduce a grid, rows and columns.

## Lecture 10

Solve a nonogram.

## Lecture 11

Names tuples as compound datastructures. Reading and writing files. Exceptions.

## Lecture 12

Major speed improvement.

## Lecture 13

Dictionaries. Generate the smallest "unsolveable" nonogram.

## Lecture 14

Use `pyx` to generate PDFs of a nonogram or solution.

## Lecture 15

Use `pgzero` to visualize it all on the screen.
